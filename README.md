# Light-monitoring-using-Z-score-analysis
IoT and ML integration project
An LDR is placed in a room and it calculates the intensity of light incident on it. The project uses Z score analysis to identify sudden changes and notify the user when a light is switched on or off. This IoT solution, integrated with an ML algorithm, allows the user to determine whether the house has been broken into and whether the thief has accessed the light switch. However, this is only one use case, and it significantly improves user experience in home automation projects.
